[[Newton 1]]
	An object will remain in a [[state of rest]] or continue to move with a [[constant velocity]] unless acted upon by a resultant external force.
	Doesn't mean an object will remain at rest if a [[F<sub>r</sub>  = 0]], it will keep its initial Velocity.
	When [[F<sub>r</sub> = 0]] then we can say that a body is in [[equilibrium]].
[[Newton 2]]
	ΣF = Δ(mv)/Δt -> [[F=ma]]
	<u>F</u><sub>r</sub> = m<u>a</u><sub>r</sub> 
	The [[acceleration]] of [[a body of constant mass]] is proportional to the [[resultant force]] applied to it and in the direction of the [[resultant force]].
	Only applies to [[fixed masses]].
[[Newton 3]]
	- Always applies to a pair of objects.
	- Every [[action]] has an [equal and opposite] [reaction]
		only acts on pairs of forces which:
			act on two separate [[bodies]]
			are of the same type
			act along the same [[line]]
			are [[equal]] in magnitude
			act in [[opposite]] directions
[[Centre of Gravity]]
	Point at which the [[weight]] of the object can be said to act.
