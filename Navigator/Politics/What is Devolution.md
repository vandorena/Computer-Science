[[Devolution]] refers to the process where power is delegated to specific regions of a state, but where [[sovereignty]] does not change. This means that the ultimate [[legal authority]] remains with the [[central power]] that held it originally.
[[Devolution]] is different to [[Federalism]].
The [[Labour Party]] first pushed for devolution in the [[UK]] with the support of the Liberals in the 1970s. 
[[Referendums]] in 1979 then took place in both [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] to decided whether or not devolution should be enacted.
